## Intro

In [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/), [App Templates](https://docs.portainer.io/user/docker/templates) enable you to easily deploy services with a predetermined configuration, while allowing you to customize options through the web UI. While Portainer ships with some default templates (see [portainer/templates](https://github.com/portainer/templates)), it's often helpful to have 1-click access to many more apps + stacks, without having to constantly switch template sources.

This repo combines app templates from several [sources](#sources), to create a ready-to-go [template file](https://github.com/Lissy93/portainer-templates/blob/main/templates.json) containing all the apps you'll ever need. It's also possible to self-host, as well as combine with your own custom templates.

You can browse all supported apps and stacks and see stats, config options and stand-alone installation commands for each, at [portainer-templates.as93.net](https://portainer-templates.as93.net)

---

## Usage

1. Log into your Portainer web UI
2. Under <ins>Settings</ins> --> <ins>App Templates</ins>, update the URL to
    - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lissy93/portainer-templates/main/templates.json`
3. Now under <ins>Home</ins> --> <ins>App Templates</ins>, you should see all apps. Click one to deploy.

</details>

Alternatively, when you start Portainer, you can append the `--templates` flag pointing to the templates URL. 

---

## Self-Hosting

If you'd prefer to source templates locally, you can self-host with Docker - there's a sample NGINX container provided<br>
Just run: `docker run -p 8080:80 lissy93/portainer-templates` (changing 8080 to a port of your choice)<br>
You'll then be able to pass Portainer the template file located at `http://[host]:[port]/templates.json`<br>

Alternatively, you can build the image yourself locally, with the following commands (if you're using your own fork, don't forget to switch `lissy93` out for your username!)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lissy93/portainer-templates.git
cd portainer-templates
docker build -t portainer-templates .
docker run -d -p "8080:80" portainer-templates
```

If you're using your own template file, but don't want to fork this repository, you can instead simply pass your `templates.json` file to the above Docker container as a volume, with `-v "${PWD}/templates.json:/usr/share/nginx/html/templates.json"`

---

## Editing

The `template.json` file is generated using the scripts in [`lib`](https://github.com/Lissy93/portainer-templates/tree/main/lib), using GitHub Actions.
Running the `make` command will download all listed sources, parse them, and combine them with anything in the sources dir, outputting the `templates.json` file.<br>
_So, you only need to edit **either** the [`sources.csv`](https://github.com/Lissy93/portainer-templates/blob/main/sources.csv) file, **or** add your templates directly into the [`sources/`](https://github.com/Lissy93/portainer-templates/tree/main/sources) directory._

### Adding a new Source
If you're maintaining your own list of Portainer templates, and would like them to be included, just add the URL to your template.json file to [`sources.csv`](https://github.com/Lissy93/portainer-templates/blob/main/sources.csv), along with a name.
When the action runs, it will download the content, parse it and add it to the final template.

### Adding a Template / Template list
Alternatively, place your template file within the [`sources`](https://github.com/Lissy93/portainer-templates/tree/main/sources) directory, and it will be automatically combined into the main `template.json`. Be sure that your template corresponds to [Portainer's App Template JSON Format](https://docs.portainer.io/advanced/app-templates/format).

### Validating Templates
There is a schema defined in [`Schema.json`](https://github.com/Lissy93/portainer-templates/blob/main/Schema.json), which can be used to validate any Portainer template.
Run `make validate` to ensure your template conforms to Portainer's App Template [specification](https://docs.portainer.io/advanced/app-templates/format).

### Maintaining your own Templates
If you'd like to use this repo as a base, but maintain your own list of template, just fork the repository, and update `lissy93` with your username in the import URL.

## Raising Issues

If you notice something not working as it should in any of the [`lib/` scripts](https://github.com/Lissy93/portainer-templates/tree/main/lib), [`website` code](https://github.com/Lissy93/portainer-templates/tree/website), [`README` documentation](https://github.com/Lissy93/portainer-templates/tree/main/.github/README.md), or [`workflows` automations](https://github.com/Lissy93/portainer-templates/tree/main/.github/workflows) - then raise an issue or PR in this repository.

If you encounter an issue with any container included here, please raise a ticket/PR on the up-stream repo, **<ins>not in this repository</ins>**.
This project simply compiles templates listed in the [Sources](#sources) into a single manifest, so once a fix has been pushed out upstream, it will be available here.

---

## Contributing

Contributions of any kind are very welcome, and would be much appreciated.
For Code of Conduct, see [Contributor Convent](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).

Not a coder? You can still help, by raising bugs you find, updating docs, or consider sponsoring me on GitHub

For a guide on adding templates, see the [Editing](#editing) section above (TLDR; either update sources.csv, or paste your template collection into the ./sources directory).
Or, to make changes to the website, see the [Website](#website) section below.

Before raising an issue or editing a template, please see the [Raising Issues](#raising-issues) section above (TL;DR: changes need to be made upstream, NOT in this repo).

If you're new to open source, I've put together some guides in [Git-In](https://github.com/Lissy93/git-into-open-source/), but feel free to reach out if you need any support.

---

## Website
There's a simple website, which lists all available templates and shows stats, config options and installation instructions for each app / stack. You can view it at **[portainer-templates.netlify.app](https://portainer-templates.netlify.app/)**<br>


The source is located in the [`website`](https://github.com/Lissy93/portainer-templates/tree/website) branch, and it's build as a simple SSR Svelte app (using SvelteKit + TypeScript + SCSS + Vite).
To make changes to the website, you'll need Node.js and Git installed. Then just run the following commands:
```bash
git clone -b website git@github.com:Lissy93/portainer-templates.git # Clone the website branch
cd portainer-templates # Navigate into the directory
npm i # Install dependencies
npm run dev # Start the development server
```

And to pubish, run `npm run build` then either use `npm start` or host the content of the '/build' directory using a web server of your choice. Alternatively, there's a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Lissy93/portainer-templates/blob/website/Dockerfile), for easy deployment :)

Note that it's not required to make any changes to the website when adding a new template or templates source, as data is fetched directly from [`templates.json`](https://github.com/Lissy93/portainer-templates/blob/main/templates.json) in the repo's main branch - so should show up automatically once your changes are merged.

---

## Mirror

There's a mirror of this repository, maintained on CodeBerg at: **[codeberg.org/alicia/portainer-templates](https://codeberg.org/alicia/portainer-templates)**

To pull templates from there, instead of GitHub, use this URL in your Portainer instance instead:

```
https://codeberg.org/alicia/portainer-templates/raw/branch/main/templates.json
```
